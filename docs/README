# OctoAcme Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme’s project management processes are designed to promote clarity, consistency, and iterative delivery across cross-functional teams. The lifecycle begins with project initiation, where a business need is validated, stakeholders are identified, and success criteria are defined through a concise One-pager. Once approved, planning activities break work into shippable increments, establish a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria, and map out dependencies and risks. Throughout execution, the delivery team leverages a structured workflow using project boards, regular standups, and milestone-based demos to track progress and resolve blockers efficiently.

Core roles are clearly defined to ensure accountability and alignment. The Project Manager (PM) oversees timelines, risks, and communication, while the Product Manager (PdM) owns the product vision and prioritization of the backlog. Developers focus on implementing features to meet acceptance criteria and maintain high code quality, and QA participants validate releases. Stakeholders are engaged for inputs and approvals at key stages, creating a culture of shared ownership and transparency.

Communication is a cornerstone of OctoAcme’s approach, with regular weekly syncs between PM and PdM, twice-weekly standups for the delivery team, and monthly updates for stakeholders. Escalation paths are explicitly documented for risks and blockers, ensuring issues are addressed at the appropriate level—from team triage to sponsor involvement for business-impacting incidents. Templates for status updates and incident communications standardize information flow and facilitate timely, actionable responses.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout the process via comprehensive testing practices—unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests—alongside automated CI pipelines for security scanning and linting. Regular retrospectives and continuous improvement cycles ensure learnings are captured and converted into actionable enhancements. Checklists embedded in each phase help teams maintain process rigor, from initiation and planning through release, deployment, and post-mortem reviews. This holistic approach supports consistent, repeatable execution and fosters a culture of transparency, feedback, and ongoing improvement.
